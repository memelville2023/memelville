        <p> Hello, My name is Mia. I was about nine years old when I first picked up a camera. 
            Ever since that moment, I have been in love with photography. I absoultly love taking photos. I love the whole process that goes into taking photos. 
            I specialize at landscape photography. However I am slowly branching out to different forms of photography.
            I hope you like what you see.
